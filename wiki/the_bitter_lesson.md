# The Bitter Lesson

The Bitter Lesson is an essay by computer scientist [Rich Sutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton) in which he points out that success
in AI has come by a "brute force" approach of building bigger ANNs, using more computation, etc, rather than through humans manually imbuing an AI
with expertise.
